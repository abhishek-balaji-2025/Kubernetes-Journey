# Introduction to Kubernetes Architecture

Welcome! This guide is designed for beginners who want to understand the foundational concepts of Kubernetes — the powerful system that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

By mastering these foundational ideas, you’ll build a solid base to easily explore and add more advanced Kubernetes concepts and features later on.

## Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes architecture consists of two core components: the **Control Plane** and the **Data Plane**.

**Simple analogy:**  
The control plane is where the brain power resides, making decisions and managing intelligence, while the data plane is the muscle power that brings those decisions to life and keeps the system running.

---

### Core Components of the Control Plane

- **API Server (kube-apiserver)**  
  The API server acts as the central management entity for the cluster. It exposes the Kubernetes API and is the main communication hub.

- **etcd**  
  etcd acts like the memory for the entire Kubernetes architecture, storing all the cluster’s configuration and state information reliably.  
  Even if the entire Kubernetes architecture crashes or fails, etcd persistently stores all the cluster’s data, ensuring that the state and configuration information is safely preserved and can be recovered.  
  You can launch a new Kubernetes cluster using a restored etcd backup, which allows the new cluster to resume with the same configuration, state, and resources as the old one.

- **Controller Manager**  
  Tracks and monitors the cluster state stored in etcd. It continuously compares the **actual state** of the cluster to the **desired state** and takes necessary actions to make sure they match.

- **Scheduler**  
  Acts like a smart dispatcher that assigns pods to the most suitable nodes in the cluster.

### Communication in Kubernetes

All core components in Kubernetes communicate with each other through the API server, which acts as the central intermediary or “middleman” for the entire architecture.

---

### Data Plane (Worker Nodes)

- **Worker nodes** are computing devices that actually run your workloads (pods).  
- **Pods** are the smallest deployable units that run your containers on these nodes.  
- The control plane is the brain that tells nodes what to run and when.

---

### Components inside Each Worker Node

- **kubelet**  
  An agent running within the worker node in the data plane. Present inside every worker node, it ensures that containers are running in a pod.

- **kube-proxy**  
  Manages network rules on nodes and allows communication to your pods.

- **Docker Engine (or other container runtime)**  
  Runs the actual containers inside pods.

---

### Interaction with Kubernetes

The DevOps engineer interacts with the entire Kubernetes architecture via **kubectl**, a command-line interface that executes commands within the Kubernetes cluster.  
kubectl acts as an interface between the DevOps engineer and the Kubernetes cluster, enabling users to communicate with and manage the cluster’s resources through command-line commands.

---

### Key Terms

- **Actual state:** The current condition of the cluster — what is really happening right now.  
- **Desired state:** What the DevOps engineer wants the cluster to be — the target configuration and status.
