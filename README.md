# Kubernetes Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Kubernetes repository** – a personal logbook of my hands-on learning experience with container orchestration using Kubernetes. This repo captures my progression from foundational concepts to real-world implementations. 

Inside, you'll find:

- ✅ Step-by-step deployments  
- 📄 YAML manifests and Helm charts  
- 📝 Notes, best practices, and gotchas  
- 🔬 Mini-projects and experiments  

My goal with this repo is to deepen my understanding of cloud-native architecture and build a solid foundation for managing scalable, resilient applications in production environments.

Feedback, suggestions, and collaboration are always welcome!
